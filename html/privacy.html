<p class="p2">
Protecting personal information is one of the Entertainment Software Rating Board ("ESRB")'s core values. As a trusted privacy seal provider since 1999, we're committed to respecting the privacy rights of our mobile and online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting all information that you may choose to share with us. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Mobile Privacy Policy ("MPP") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us on our mobile applications.</p>
<p class="p2">This MPP and the certification seal shown on this page confirms that our mobile applications submit to the terms of <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp"><span class="s1">ESRB's Privacy Certified Program</span></a> (<a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp"><span class="s1">http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp</span></a>). ESRB's Privacy Certified Program is designed to ensure that a member's information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our mobile applications have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our mobile applications and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms.</p>
<p class="p3">This MPP applies only to the following:</p>
<p class="p4">(a)<span class="s2">  </span>personal and non-personal information submitted and/or collected on the mobile applications where this MPP is posted, but does not apply to any other information collected by ESRB through any other means including its website(s) or offline;</p>
<p class="p4">(b)<span class="s2">  </span> use and sharing of personal and non-personal information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted; and</p>
<p class="p4">(c)<span class="s2">  </span>mobile applications maintained by ESRB, and not to our international affiliates, or any mobile applications maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. ESRB is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those mobile applications. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of any third party applications before providing your personal information.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">Finally, the terms of this MPP are subject to all applicable laws.</p>

<p class="p3"><b><i>Q1. What information may be collected?</i></b></p>
<p class="p3">A1. <b>Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="p3">Personal Information is information that can be used to identify and contact you such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or unique device identifiers, photo, video or audio files, or your geographic location. We do not collect any personal information about you unless you choose to provide it to us. We do not require personal information to access our mobile applications. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to access certain features of our mobile applications such as sweepstakes or surveys. To offer users certain features on our mobile application and to ensure we provide the best experience possible, we may collect the following types of personal information:</p>
<p class="p4">(a)<span class="s2">  </span>First and/or last name</p>
<p class="p4">(b)<span class="s2">  </span>Email address</p>
<p class="p4">(c)<span class="s2">  </span>Birthdate</p>
<p class="p4">(d)<span class="s2">  </span>City and state of residence</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><b>Children</b></p>
<p class="p3">We do not knowingly collect personal information from users under the age of 13. We take children's privacy seriously, and encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children's privacy at all times.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Information You Provide to Us</b></p>
<p class="p3">All of the personal information we receive comes directly from users of our mobile applications.</p>
<p class="p3">We may also collect demographic (i.e. non-personal) information, which is anonymous information such as your age, date of birth, gender, zip/postal code, hobbies, platform preferences, and other game ownership and preferences. If demographic information is collected at the same time as your personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the content we provide you according to your interests and preferences. Demographic information is not considered personal information unless it is linked to personal information about a specific user. If you choose not to provide certain demographic information, you may not be able to access certain features on our mobile applications.</p>
<p class="p3">Additionally, we may collect aggregate information, which is anonymous data about individuals that is grouped together to study a group or category of services or users. Aggregate information is not considered personal information unless it is linked to personal information about a specific user.</p>
<p class="p3">We will only retain personal information about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this MPP unless a longer retention period is required by law and/or regulations.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Information Collected Through Technology</b></p>
<p class="p3">We collect information through technology to make our mobile applications more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you use one of our mobile applications, we collect your unique device identifier, which is a code embedded into your device by the manufacturer.  By capturing this code, we develop a better understanding in aggregate of how users interact with our mobile applications, the types of devices used, along with other demographic information. We may, at times, combine this information with personal information.</p>
<a name="q2"></a>
<p class="p3"><b><i> </i></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Q2. How is your information used?</i></b></p>
<p class="p3">A2. We do not require you to disclose personal information to use our mobile applications. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to access certain features of our mobile application such as app user surveys.</p>
<p class="p3">Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Sweepstakes, Surveys</b></p>
<p class="p3">Information, personal or otherwise, collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us may be used to:</p>
<p class="p4">(a)<span class="s2">  </span>Enter sweepstakes or contests via the mobile app, or;</p>
<p class="p4">(b)<span class="s2">  </span>Participate in polls, surveys, questionnaires</p>
<p class="p3">In each of our sweepstakes, contests and/or surveys, users are provided with an option not to participate, in which case no personal information will be collected by us.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Operational Uses</b></p>
<p class="p3">We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your personal information (e.g. email address) to send you administrative communications either about the mobile application or any future changes to this MPP.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Analytics</b></p>
<p class="p3">Finally, we may take your personal information and make it non-personal, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this MPP on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<a name="q3"></a>
<p class="p3"><b><i> </i></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Q3. With whom is your information shared?</i></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>A3. </i>Disclosures Required for Operational Uses</b></p>
<p class="p3">We occasionally use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services necessary to our operations. For example, we have partnered with other companies to design and develop our mobile applications, implement sweepstakes and promotions, analyze users' interaction with our mobile application, and process consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these companies may have contact with your personal information. These entities have agreed to securely store and maintain any personal information received from us.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Mobile Applications and Others</b></p>
<p class="p3">We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. We may share personal information with vendors who help us perform various internal functions necessary to operate our business. We may disclose personal information (a) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law; (b) if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to any claims; (d) to enforce the terms and conditions of our website; or (e) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ESRB, users, or the public. Any vendors or partners with whom we may share personal information are permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the services requested. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Q4. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your information?</i></b></p>
<p class="p3">A4. The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We use robust security measures to protect user information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted communications, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted personal information by email or by posting a notice on the affected mobile application. We also strive to limit access to personal information to employees performing a legitimate business function. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. Despite our efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Q5. How can you remove or update your personal information?</i></b></p>
<p class="p3">A5. You can request to remove or update the contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your e-mail address or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you), by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@esrb.org?subject=Personal%20Information%20Update"><span class="s1">privacy@esrb.org</span></a>.</p>

<p class="p3"><b><i>Q8. Do California residents have special rights?</i></b></p>
<p class="p3">A8. Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of this mobile application who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, as stated above in A3 we do not share information with third parties, for their direct marketing purposes or otherwise, unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. But, if you believe your information has been shared or you have general questions about how your information may have been shared, you may contact us at:</p>
